excerpt: "Three chapters of the book are now available for free thanks to the sponsorship of New Relic."
---

The first three chapters of the book are now available for *free* [from New
Relic](http://newrelic.com/docker-book) who have kindly sponsored this preview
release.

The authors have been running Docker *in production for a year* and a half and
can *now pass on some of that valuable experience to you*.

In these chaptes you'll learn a little about Docker's history, what a container is and is not, how
Docker is different from other solutions, and why it might be a good fit for
you. By the time you're finished with the free preview, you'll have Docker
installed and running on your development system.
